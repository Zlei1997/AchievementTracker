Compile this program in sun.cse.tamu.edu \n
  (You can really use any but I noticed in linux2 it would switch the last two games around in the SummarizePlayer output)

First compile the program with: javac *.java
Second run the program with: java Main < commands.txt
You can replace commands.txt with any .txt file you would like, just make sure that the file is in the same directory as the java files.
If you want to type all of the commands in the command prompt, type them in one at a time. Don't use Copy/Paste.
