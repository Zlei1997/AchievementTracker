Compile this program in sun.cse.tamu.edu <br />
  (You can really use any but I noticed in linux2 it would switch the last two games around in the SummarizePlayer output)<br />

First compile the program with: javac *.java<br />
Second run the program with: java Main < commands.txt<br />
You can replace commands.txt with any .txt file you would like, just make sure that the file is in the same directory as the java files.<br />
If you want to type all of the commands in the command prompt, type them in one at a time. Don't use Copy/Paste.<br />
